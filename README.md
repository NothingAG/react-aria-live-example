# React aria-live example

> Working draft

Running React as SPA with routing but without aria-live will not make screenreaders aware of route changes by default.

The code in this repository shows an example on how to enhance React applications with aria-live to make screenreaders aware of route changes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

See full documentation for using the create-react-template [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
